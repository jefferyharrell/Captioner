- The backend should also detect when new images are placed into the folder and add them to the database as well.
- Implement a /rescan endpoint that triggers a manual rescan of the images folder (returns immediate ack; frontend refreshes after delay).
- Implement thumbnail caching logic (in-memory, default 100MB, configurable, with eviction policy) as per SPEC.md.
- The backend should use `coverage` in addition to `pytest` for testing and code coverage.
